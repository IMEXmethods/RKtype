Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) Runge-Kutta (RK) Methods 

We identify each IMEX-RK scheme using the triplet (s, σ, p) to characterize the number s of stages in the implicit scheme, the number σ of stages in the explicit scheme, and the order p of the method.  

In the double Butcher tableau of the IMEX-RK scheme, the explicit part is presented before the implicit one. This sequencing is due to our consideration of a system in an additive form U′ =F(U)+G(U), where the approach involves explicit treatment of the function F and implicit treatment of the function G.
